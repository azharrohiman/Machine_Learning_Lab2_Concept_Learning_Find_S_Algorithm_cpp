Muhammad Azhar Rohiman - RHMMUH005. CSC3022H - Lab 2.

Instructions on how to compile, run and use the program:

1) cd to folder containing cpp and h files. 'cd Week2'

2) type 'make' command in terminal to create object and executable files

3) type 'make clean' to remove object and executable files

4) to run the program, type 'make run' or './driver' in terminal

5) the find-S algorithm will be run to obtain the trace as in Section 4 of Tom Mitchell's book

6) the second part of the lab is carried out by creating a random example from a given set of attributes.
   the number of examples needed for the set of training examples to match the target concept will be outputted to the text file
   since the generation of the example is random, the number of examples required will be different

5) an "output.txt" file will be created containing the output of the program
